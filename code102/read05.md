Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>)
are used to compare two operands.

Logical operators allow you to combine more than one
set of comparison operators.


if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code
if a condition is true, and another if it is false.

Data types can be coerced from one type to another.
All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy.

JavaScript can convert data
types behind the scenes to
complete an operation.

Loops check a condition . If it returns true , a code block will run .
Then the condition will be checked again and if still returns true , the code block will run again .It repeats until the condition returns false .
