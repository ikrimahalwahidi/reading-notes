 Chapter 10 : Introducing CSS

 
1- CSS treats each HTML e XX lement as if it appears inside
its own box and uses rules to indicate how that
element should look.
  2- Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the
 elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that
indicate what these elements should look like).
3- Different types of selectors allow you to target your
rules at different elements.
4-  Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties
of the element that you want to change, and the values
of those properties. For example, the font-family
property sets the choice of font, and the value arial
specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
5-  CSS rules usually appear in a separate document,
although they may appear within an HTML page.



Chapter 11 : Color




1 - There are three ways to specify colors in CSS:
RGB values, hex codes, and color names.
 2- Color pickers can help you find the color you want.
3-  It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast
between any text and the background color (otherwise
people will not be able to read your content).
 4- CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to
indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.
5- CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values,
with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.
