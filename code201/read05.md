#Chapter 5: “Images” (pp.94-125) 

There are many reasons why you might
want to add an image to a web page: you
might want to include a logo, photograph,
illustration, diagram, or chart.
There are several things to consider when selecting and
preparing images for your site, but taking time to get them
right will make it look more attractive and professional.
In this chapter you will learn how to:
Include an image i ●● n your web pages using HTML
●● Pick which image format to use
●● Show an image at the right size
●● Optimize an image for use on the web to make pages
load faster

The <img> element is used to add images to a
web page.
You must always specify a src attribute to indicate the
source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the
content of an image.
You should save images at the size you will be using
them on the web page and in the appropriate format.
Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or
logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.




# Chapter 11: “Color” (pp.246-263)

Color can really bring your pages to life.
In this chapter we will look at:
How to specify colors, a ●● s there are three common ways in
which you can indicate your choice of colors (plus extra
ways made available in CSS3)
●● Color terminology, as there are some terms that are very
helpful to understand when it comes to picking colors
●● Contrast, and ensuring that your text is readable
●● Background colors for behind either your entire page or
parts of a page.

RGB Values
Values for red, green, and blue
are expressed as numbers
between 0 and 255.
rgb(102,205,170)
This color is made up of the
following values:
102 red
205 green
170 blue
Hex Codes
Hex values represent values
for red, green, and blue in
hexadecimal code.
#66cdaa
The value of the red, 102, is
expressed as 66 in hexadecimal
code. The 205 of the green is
expressed as cd and the 170 of
the blue equates to aa.
Color Names
Colors are represented by
predefined names. However,
they are very limited in number.
MediumAquaMarine
There are 147 color names
supported by browsers (this
color is MediumAquaMarine).
Most consider this to be a
limited color palette, and it is
hard to remember the name for
each of the colors so (apart from
white and black) they are not
commonly used.

Color not only brings your s XX ite to life, but also helps
convey the mood and evokes reactions.
There are three ways to specify colors in CSS:
RGB values, hex codes, and color names.
Color pickers can help you find the color you want.
It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast
between any text and the background color (otherwise
people will not be able to read your content).
CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to
indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.
CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values,
with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.




# Chapter 12: “Text” (pp.264-299)

The properties that allow you to control
the appearance of text can be split into
two groups:
Those that directly affect t ●● he font and its appearance
(including the typeface, whether it is regular, bold or italic,
and the size of the text)
Those that would have the same effect on text no matter
what font you were using (including the color of text and
the spacing between words and letters)
The formatting of your text can have a significant effect
on how readable your pages are. As we look through these
properties I will also give you some design tips on how to
display your type.


There are properties to control t XX he choice of font, size,
weight, style, and spacing.
There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume
most people will have installed.
If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are
several options, but you need to have the right license
to use them.
You can control the space between lines of text,
individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned
to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be
indented.
You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an
element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or
when they have visited a link.
