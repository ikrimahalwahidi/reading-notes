HTML pages are text documents.
 HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled
brackets) to give the information they surround special
meaning.
 Tags are often referred to as elements.
 Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
the end.
 Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
about the content of that element.
 Attributes require a name and a value.
 To learn HTML you need to know what tags are
available for you to use, what they do, and where they
can go.

DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you
are using.
You can add comments to your code between the
<!-- and --> markers.
 The id and class attributes allow you to identify
particular elements.
 The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group
block-level and inline elements together.
 <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through
which other pages can be displayed.
 The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of
information about your web page.
 Escape characters are used to include special
characters in your pages such as <, >, and ©.

The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of
different parts of a web page and help to describe
its structure.
The new elements provide clearer code (compared
with using multiple <div> elements).

Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
 Wireframes allow you to organize the information that
will need to go on each page.
